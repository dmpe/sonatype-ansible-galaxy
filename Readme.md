## Developing

### Requirements

* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Also, there is a good amount of information available at [Bundle Development](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development)

### Download


### Building

To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven

    mvn clean package -PbuildKar 

If everything checks out, the bundle for apk should be available in the `target` folder

#### Build with Docker

```
buildah bud -t nexus-repository-ansible:latest .
podman run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus nexus-repository-ansible:latest
```

#### Run as a Docker container

`docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus nexus-repository-apk:0.0.1` 

For further information like how to persist volumes check out [the GitHub repo for our official image](https://github.com/sonatype/docker-nexus3).

The application will now be available from your browser at http://localhost:8081

## Using apk With Nexus Repository Manager 3

[We have detailed instructions on how to get started here!](docs/APK_USER_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Compatibility with Nexus Repository Manager 3 Versions

The table below outlines what version of Nexus Repository the plugin was built against

| Plugin Version | Nexus Repository Version |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| v0.0.1         | 3.19.0-01                |
| v0.0.8         | 3.23.0-03                |
| v0.0.12        | 3.28.0-01                |

If a new version of Nexus Repository is released and the plugin needs changes, a new release will be made, and this
table will be updated to indicate which version of Nexus Repository it will function against. This is done on a time 
available basis, as this is community supported. If you see a new version of Nexus Repository, go ahead and update the
plugin and send us a PR after testing it out!

All released versions can be found [here](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-repository-apk/releases).

## Features Implemented In This Plugin 

| Feature | Implemented          |
|---------|----------------------|
| Proxy   | :heavy_check_mark:   |
| Hosted  |                      |
| Group   |                      |

## Installing the plugin

There are a range of options for installing the apk plugin. You'll need to build it first, and
then install the plugin with the options shown below:

### Permanent Install

Thanks to some upstream work in Nexus Repository, it's become a LOT easier to install a plugin. To install the `apk` plugin, follow these steps:

* Build the plugin with `mvn clean package -PbuildKar`
* Copy the `nexus-repository-apk-0.0.1-bundle.kar` file from your `target` folder to the `deploy` folder for your Nexus Repository installation.

Once you've done this, go ahead and either restart Nexus Repo, or go ahead and start it if it wasn't running to begin with.

You should see `apk (proxy)` in the available Repository Recipes to use, if all has gone according to plan :)

### Temporary Install

Installations done via the Karaf console will be wiped out with every restart of Nexus Repository. This is a
good installation path if you are just testing or doing development on the plugin.

* Enable Nexus Repo console: edit `<nexus_dir>/bin/nexus.vmoptions` and change `karaf.startLocalConsole`  to `true`.

  More details here: [Bundle Development](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development+Overview)

* Run Nexus Repo console:
  ```shell
  # sudo su - nexus
  $ cd <nexus_dir>/bin
  $ ./nexus run
  > bundle:install file:///tmp/nexus-repository-apk-0.0.1.jar
  > bundle:list
  ```
  (look for org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-apk ID, should be the last one)
  ```
  > bundle:start <org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-apk ID>
  ```

### Other Permanent Install Options

There are two other outdated options for Permanent Installation that can be found in the Composer Community Format's [\(more\) Permanent Install](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-repository-composer/blob/master/README.md#more-permanent-install) and [\(most\) Permanent Install](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-repository-composer/blob/master/README.md#most-permanent-install) instructions. Replace all references to Composer with apk.

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Don't worry, using this community item does not "void your warranty". In a worst case scenario, you may be asked 
by the Sonatype Support team to remove the community item in order to determine the root cause of any issues.

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to apk support in regard to this plugin
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
